This app will allow its user to look through a list of images provided by Giphy, The user will also have the ability to add their favorites to a list for safe keeping. They will also have the ability to add 1 of 5 categories to each image they have selected for safe keeping. Then using 1 of the 5 categories the user can simply narrow down to the exact giphy they want to share with someone ultimately giving the user a streamless experience to find the content they seek. 

This app also has a search bar included for the user to have easier access to narrowing down the giphy images they wish to see. Many giphy images are at the user's disposal.

Along with these user experiences we have also included the user ability to remove an image they have selected as a favorite to no longer be kept as a favorite. 


Starter data for the postico table can be found in the  data.sql file.
All styling is done with MUI
